# Managing Environments with Nix

Some experiments I would like to do:

- With `pkgs.dockerTools`, I would like to build and export container images to use with WSL.
- Start with nix-flakes and new Nix CLI.
- Home-manager doesn't work well with the new Nix. However, I think I could use home-manager as nix flakes modules.
